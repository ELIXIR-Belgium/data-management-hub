## Metabolome
The metabolome is the global collection of all low molecular weight metabolites that are produced by cells during metabolism, and provides a direct functional readout of cellular activity and physiological status (from *Advances in Genetics, 2016*, [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/metabolome)).

Metabolomics is the large-scale study of small molecules, commonly known as metabolites, within cells, biofluids, tissues or organisms ([EMBL-EBI training]([https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training-beta/online/courses/metabolomics-introduction/what-is/])).

## Recommended repositories
* [MetaboLights](metabolights).
MetaboLights is the first general purpose, open access repository for metabolomics studies, their raw experimental data and associated metadata ([EMBL-EBI train online](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/metabolights-quick-tour/what-metabolights)).
