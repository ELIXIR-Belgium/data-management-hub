title: Datasets sharing and reuse
---

Datasets sharing
* is meant as making your datasets known to the whole world and to society
* does NOT necessarily mean Open Access nor Public; datasets can be shared with Closed or Restricted Access
* does NOT have to happen immediately nor while you are still working on the project; data can be shared after your scientific paper is published
* is NOT the same as sharing the result of your research by publishing an article; datasets are the collection of values used in your article or manuscript


## 1. Which datasets will be shared and made available (for the society) after the end of the project? Distinguish open access datasets from restricted or closed access datasets.

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope]

### Meaning
What does open, closed and restricted access mean?

* Open access: there are no restrictions on access to the data; anyone can view and download a copy.
* Closed access: a description of your dataset is published (metadata); however, the dataset can only be accessed by its subject, owner or holder.
* Restricted access: a description of your dataset is published (metadata) and provides information on how to apply for access to the data (registered access, access upon request etc...).
* Embargoed: the dataset can't be accessed until the end of a specified time period, after which it becomes Open, Closed or Restricted access.

### Example answers
* Open access: Datasets [Name] and [Name]; 
Restricted access: Datasets [Name] and [Name]; 
Closed access: Datasets [Name].
* All datasets will be open access.

## 2. Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data? Per dataset with restricted or closed access, provide a rationale for doing so.

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope] 

<!--### Meaning-->

### Example answers
* For dataset [Name], the legal agreement with a 3rd party states the following: [explain briefly].
* Dataset [Name] contains personal data that require restricted access, only metadata will be open.
* For dataset [Name], the researcher involved and the IP team will make the necessary arrangements in order to maintain the embargo on the data access, at least until essential steps in securing intellectual property have been taken.
* There are no restricting factors for any datasets.

## 3. Per dataset, list the repositories in which data, metadata, code, software and related documentation will be shared. If research materials and protocols will be shared in centralised repositories, specify it below.

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope]

### Meaning
Some repositories give open access to the data as default; while other repositories allow restricted or closed access. Check the access conditions to the data before choosing a repository.

### Example answers
* Datasets [Name] and [Name]: [Repository Name].
* RNA-seq on Arabidopsis: ArrayExpress. Code on Github.
* Biomodel of X protein complex: BioModels. Code and software on Github.
* Plasmids in Addgene.

## 5. Per dataset, state when it will be made available. Is embargo foreseen?

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope] 

### Meaning
Embargo: it is a defined period of time, imposed by the author, which prohibits access to data. After the embargo period, data becomes Open, Closed or Restricted access.

Check if the repositories of your choice allow embargo period.

### Example answers
* All datasets listed in this DMP will be made available upon publication of research results.

| ScienceEurope | 5d. How will the application of a unique and persistent identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)) to each data set be ensured? | • Explain how the data might be re-used in other contexts. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) should be applied so that data can be reliably and efficiently located and referred to. PIDs also help to track citations and re-use. • Indicate whether a PID for the data will be pursued. Typically, a trustworthy, long-term repository will provide a persistent identifier. |

## 8. Will metadata be made openly available and licenced under a public licence? Check your funder requirements and specify the licence.

### Asked by
[HorizonEurope] 

### Meaning
First, check the requirement of your funder about metadata availability and licence; then, check what repositories allows you to comply with those requirements.

### Example answers
* Metadata will be made available in Zenodo under a CC-BY licence.
* Metadata will be made available in the institutional repository X under the licence Y, as requested by our funder.
