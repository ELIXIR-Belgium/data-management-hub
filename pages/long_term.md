## 1. [FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope] List which datasets will be preserved or not for some years after the end of the project and explain why (legal, contractual restrictions etc..).
### Meaning
Every funder or institution might requires to preserve the data, after the end of the project, for different number of years. Check requirements of your funder or institute about data preservation after the project.
### Example answers
* All the generated datasets will be stored for long term.
* All relevant data for reuse and experiment replicability will be preserved for 10 years after the end of the project.
* Dataset [Name] will be deleted after [X] years because of the following [contractual, legal, ethical...] reasons: [explain].

## 3. [FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope] Estimate the costs for long term preservation (or archiving).
### Meaning
Specify the costs charged to your research team.

Multiply the cost in €/TB/Year, by the number of years and the volume of data which you are going to generate (as specified in the section about data volume).
### Example answers
* Long term preservation of [X]TB for 10 years at [University Name] will cost about 2000€.
* The chosen data repositories preserve the data for free.
