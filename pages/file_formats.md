## Open vs Proprietary format

**Files in OPEN format (our favourite)**<br/>
* can be opened by anyone for free
* are less prone to become obsolete, because a variety of software should be able to open them
* examples: *file.csv* and *file.pdf* can be opened by any text editor or spreadsheet program and any pdf readers, respectively

**Files in PROPRIETARY format (non-preferred)**<br>
* can be open only by people holding the license for the needed software
* tend to be replaced by new versions or new formats, limiting their future reuse
* examples: *file.xls* and *file.ppt* can be opened only by people that own a license for Microsoft Office Software
