summary: Data is only as good as the format it is saved in. The format of a file determines which programs can be used to access it.

## Open vs Proprietary
### Files in OPEN format (recommended)
* Can be opened by anyone using different types of open-source, free or licensed software.
* Are less prone to become obsolete, because a variety of software should be able to open them.
* Have a free format specification (i.e. no patent restrictions).
* [List of open formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_formats).

### Files in PROPRIETARY format (non-preferred)
* Can only be opened using paid-licence software.
* Tend to be replaced by new versions or new formats, limiting their future reuse.
* Have an either patented or trade-secret specification.
* [List of proprietary formats]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_format).

## Recommended file formats
### Considerations before choosing a file format
* The format of raw and processed data files could depend on the instrument or the software that generates the data.
* Some data repositories could require specific file formats. In this case, information about the accepted formats can be found on the repositoryâ€™s webpage.
* It is good practice to use open or recommended formats when possible.

### Recommended file formats can be found via
* DANS, [File formats](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/services/easy/information-about-depositing-data/before-depositing/file-formats).
* UK Data Service, [Recommended formats](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/format/recommended-formats).


## Is my file format open? <!--- this section needs work. Should we include the best-practice open format for each area and technology? There is no way we can include all possible file formats --->

| Area | Technology | Format | Open |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|------|
| Genomics | Sequencing | fastq | yes |
| Proteomics | Mass spectroscopy | mzXML or mzML | yes |
