The RDM Guide is a comprehensive resource on research data management in life sciences, created and maintained by ELIXIR Belgium since 2020. It offers tailored guidance for Belgian researchers, covering national data management guidelines, resources, tools, and services. Alongside complementing the RDMkit, it provides additional support to national life sciences research. Moreover, it serves as a valuable resource for international research endeavors seeking data management solutions developed in Belgium.
