## Persistent Identifiers

A persistent identifiers (PID) can be assigned to a dataset or other research object to maximize its longevity. It consists of a unique ID and a service that ensures the right path to the object should it change locations over time. PID provide findability, persistence and authenticity to digital research objects and allow interoperability between collections and repositories.

Various PID systems exist: [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), [Handle](http://www.handle.net/), [ARK](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9p9863nc#main), [PURL](https://archive.org/services/purl/), among others. Some repositories will use a specific system and others will mint their own PIDs upon submission. Data repositories indexed at [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) can be filtered by PID system.


## Digital Object Identifier
Digital Object Identifier is the most widely adopted PID across repositories. Important among the group of [DOI Registration Agencies](https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html) are [CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org/), which assigns ID to academic publications, and [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), which does so to research data and other research outputs.
