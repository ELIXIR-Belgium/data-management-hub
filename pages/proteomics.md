## Proteome
A proteome is the complete set of proteins expressed by an organism ([Scitable by Nature Education](https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/proteome-297/)). Proteomics is the large scale study of all the proteins present in a cell, tissue or organism at any one time.

## Recommended repositories
* [PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database](pride).
PRIDE is a repository for mass spectra data. PRIDE database was set up to enable public data deposition of Mass Spectrometry (MS) proteomics data, providing access to the experimental data described in scientific publications. The main focus of PRIDE is to support the deposition of shotgun MS/MS proteomics datasets.
* [UniProt](uniprot).
UniProt is a curated and annotated protein sequence knowledge base. The mission of UniProt is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive, high-quality and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information.
