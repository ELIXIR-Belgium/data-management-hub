## Genome
The full complement of genetic material in an organism is called its genome. Therefore, genomics involves studies that are conducted at the level of the genome ([Scitable by Nature Education](https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/genomics-126/)).

## Recommended repositories
* [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](ena).
The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) provides a comprehensive record of the world’s nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation.

* European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA).
  The EGA provides a service for the permanent archiving and distribution of personally identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from biomedical research projects. Data at EGA was collected from individuals whose consent agreements authorise data release only for specific research use to bona fide researchers. Strict protocols govern how information is managed, stored and distributed by the EGA project. Nature Genetics 47, 692–695, (2015)| doi:10.1038/ng.3312
