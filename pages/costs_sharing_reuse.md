## 1. What are the estimated costs for making data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)?

### Asked by
[H2020, HorizonEurope]

### Meaning
Possible costs of making data more FAIR could be due to payment for tools or experts in order to:

* make this DMP
* acquire or transcribe or clean existing data
* harmonise file naming and organisation of folders in your project
* adopt open and standard file formats
* make your metadata and dataset machine readable
* implement metadata schemas and ontologies in your project
* draft consent form for data sharing and/or apply licence
* curate documentation about datasets
* create DOIs/PIs
* guarantee data security and/or transfer data across sites
* comply with legal requirements

(for costs about data storage, backup, archiving and data sharing, see next questions).

### Example answers
* Making data more FAIR will not have any cost, because we will use open source ELN, open source resources and software for data management and analysis during the project (DMPonline, OSF, FAIRDOMHub, UseGalaxy.be, R, GitHub).
* Making data more FAIR will not have any cost, because we will use recommended open source software and resources for data management. A common system for organisation of folders/files and curation of documentation has been implemented by the lab manager.
* Costs of data compliance consultancy will be approximately Xâ‚¬.
