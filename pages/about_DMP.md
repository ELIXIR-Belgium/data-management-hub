**Data Management Plan (DMP)**</br>Many funders are asking grant applicants to provide a Data Management Plan (DMP), before they begin any research.

**What is a DMP?**</br>A DMP is usually a document where researchers describe how they are going to manage data during and after the project: what data they will generate; how the data will be documented, described, secured and curated; and who will have access to those data after the research is completed. They must also explain any data sharing and reuse restrictions, such as legal and confidentiality issues ([Data Management Made Simple, Nature 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03071-1?utm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews&sf184398395=1 )). Any type of data, including text, spreadsheets, images, recordings, models, algorithms and software, is in the scope of DMP.

**Why do we need DMP?**</br>DMP is considered a tool to encourage researchers to value the data that they generate as much as the scientific article, in which that data is used. DMP should help preventing data loss and encourage data sharing according to the [FAIR principle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792175/). Sharing data should reduce data duplication and increase reproducibility and transparency. Moreover, accessible data can be reused by others to generate new knowledge. Overall, DMP is a tool to make research better.

**What you need to know to write a DMP**</br>Simple and practical information about writing and implementing a DMP can be found in this DM Hub.
