Before starting a project, you should contact your Data Protection Officers (DPO) to be informed of GDPR compliance requirements for your institution.

You should inform your local legal office of your project’s setup and identify the necessary agreements to be signed.

The proposal for processing of personal/sensitive data has to be submitted and approved by the appropriate Privacy Registry Reference. Write here the reference to your file.
### Example answers

If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on security be ensured? | If personal data are processed, how will compliance with legislation on personal data and on security be ensured? Ensure that when dealing with personal data data protection laws (for example GDPR) are complied with: › Consider anonymisation of personal data for preservation and/or sharing (truly anonymous data are no longer considered personal data).  › Consider pseudonymisation of personal data (the main difference with anonymisation is that pseudonymisation is reversible). › Consider encryption which is seen as a special case of pseudonymisation (the encryption key must be stored separately from the data, for instance by a trusted third party). › Explain whether there is a managed access procedure in place for authorised users of personal data. |
