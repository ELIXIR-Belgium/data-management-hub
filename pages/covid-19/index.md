ELIXIR Belgium supports the [European Corona action plan](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/covid-firsteravscorona_actions.pdf). As the life-science data Research Infrastructure in Europe, we are in a unique position to facilitate the increase in the amount of publicly available Covid-related data and its processing, publication and reuse.
To this end, ELIXIR Belgium promotes and encourages the publication of all scientific data related to the Covid  pandemic and provides the tools, know-how and brokering services for researchers to do so.

Our first action is to support the submission of SARS-Cov-2 DNA sequences to public repositories. For more info please visit:

### ELIXIR Belgium Covid-19 Galaxy instance
ELIXIR Belgium developed and maintains *usegalaxy.be/covid-19*, a custom tailored public Galaxy instance for Belgian researchers submitting SARS-Cov-2 genetic sequences to public repositories. At the moment, submissions to ENA are supported. You can apply for credentials for usegalaxy.be/covid-19 by contacting our [Galaxy admin](mailto:galaxy@elixir-belgium.org). ELIXIR Belgium holds a brokering account with ENA which is used for all submissions via *usegalaxy.be/covid-19*. This means Belgian researchers submitting sequences don't need an ENA account.
