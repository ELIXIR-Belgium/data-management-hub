ELIXIR Belgium supports the [European Corona action plan](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/covid-firsteravscorona_actions.pdf). As the life-science data Research Infrastructure in Europe, we are in a unique position to facilitate the increase in the amount of publicly available Covid-related data and its processing, publication and reuse.
To this end, ELIXIR Belgium promotes and encourages the publication of all scientific data related to the Covid  pandemic and provides the tools, know-how and brokering services for researchers to do so.

Our first action is to support the submission of SARS-Cov-2 DNA sequences to public repositories
