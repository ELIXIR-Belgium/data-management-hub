ELIXIR supports the [European Corona action plan](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/covid-firsteravscorona_actions.pdf) and plays an important role in the development of the [COVID-19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org). As the life-science data Research Infrastructure in Europe, ELIXIR is in a unique position to help increase the amount of publicly available Covid-related data and facilitate its processing, publication and reuse.

To this end, ELIXIR Belgium promotes and encourages the publication of all scientific data related to the Covid  pandemic and provides the tools, know-how and brokering services for researchers to do so. Our first action is to support the submission of SARS-Cov-2 nucleotide sequences to public repositories. 

We have collaboratively developed:

* ENA upload tool
* Galaxy implementation of the ENA upload tool
* Galaxy implementation of read cleaning workflow to remove human traces
* Container environment to clean and submit data to ENA

All these resources are available for use and re-use, for detailed information please visit:

### Support for Belgian researchers

We provide support for Belgian researchers to submit data as a service, through the brokering mechanism of ENA. For more information contact *datasub at elixir-belgium.org*.

To provide additional support ELIXIR Belgium is developing *usegalaxy.be/covid-19*, a custom tailored public Galaxy instance for Belgian researchers dedicated to submitting SARS-Cov-2 genetic sequences to public repositories. This is based on the developed tools, submission to ENA will be supported at this moment. 
We expect to make this available by the end of November. 

You can express interest and apply for credentials for usegalaxy.be/covid-19 by contacting our [Galaxy admin](mailto:galaxy@elixir-belgium.org).
