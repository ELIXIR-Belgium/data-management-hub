title: Datasets information
toc: true
---

Give information about sets of numbers, words, images, video/audio, scripts, algorithms and software used or generated in the project to describe or analyse research subjects and materials (sample, specimen, biomolecules and other materials).

Research materials and step-by-step experimental protocols used or generated during the project should be shared through centralized repositories and platforms. This information can be specified in the DMP.


## 1. Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data? State the reasons and specify how you will use existing data.

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope] 

### Meaning
Please, state the following in your answer:

* If there are existing data or not about your topic.
* If there are restrictions or costs on the reuse and share of third-party data (specify the details in the next questions).
* If re-use of any existing data has been considered but discarded and why (ex: incomplete data, data not reusable for legal reasons etc...).
* How existing data will be used: will you always use a specific version or update to the latest versions?

### Example answers
* I will re-use existing open access datasets on [add your topic] by combining them with my new data; no limits for sharing and re-use.
* I will only generate new data; existing data on [this topic] are sparse and inadequate because [give reasons].
* I will re-use only open access metadata of [Dataset Name] with closed access data.
* I will pay [X]€ to access [Dataset Name] from [Company Name]: data will not be shared, only metadata will be open access.

## 2. Name and list here all datasets that will be used and/or generated in this project. Add a reference for existing datasets.

### Asked by
[ERC] 

### Meaning
The name of a dataset should be short and unique in this DMP; you could also assign a unique number or ID to each dataset in this DMP. The definition of what is a dataset is extremely project-specific. Try to define each dataset based on:
* the used technique (RNA-seq, Imaging, LC/MS etc...)
* and/or the repository that could be used for data publication
* and/or sample origin (organisms, literature, etc...)
* and/or collection methods (experiment, simulation, survey, questionnaire...)

Reference for existing dataset: any identifier or accession number for keeping track of data provenance.

### Example answers
* Existing datasets: [name and access number or reference or DOI]. New datasets: [your analysis type] by [your technique] on [your organism]. Software [Name] for [your application].
* New: RNA-seq on Arabidopsis. Phenotype analysis by imaging. Existing: Arabidopsis dataset E-MTAB-XXXX.
* New: Methylation by LC/MS.
* New: Biomodel of X protein complex.

## 4. Per dataset, state its origin/source.

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope]

### Meaning
Non exhaustive list of possible attributes for data source/origin or collection mode:

* Observational, Experimental
* Quantitative, Qualitative
* Simulation
* Derived/compiled from other sources
* Digital (born-digital or digitized) or non-digital nature (e.g. paper surveys, questionnaires...)
* Surveys or questionnaires or interviews,
* Primary (generated by the researcher for a particular research purpose or project), 
* Secondary (originally created by someone else for another purpose)
* Raw, Processed
* etc

Specifying where the data come from, or when and by whom data will be generated/collected helps to identify implications for privacy (GDPR), IP and other legal or ethical aspects.

### Example answers
* Datasets [Name] and [Name] are [laboratory/field/preclinical experiments] on [organism].
* Datasets [Name] consists of measurements performed in the lab by a partner in a different (part of the) country.
* Dataset [Name] is a combination of existing data and new experimental data of [X] and [Y] platform/consortium.
* The source of [dataset name] is a collection of existing [studies/books/publications].
* The source of datasets [Name] and [Name] are quantitative [survey/interview/questionnaire] collected by a team of survey takers we hire.
* Dataset [Name] is a [qualitative or quantitative observational] study on [population/topic/subject].

## 5. Per dataset, state digital format(s) of raw and processed data files, distinguishing proprietary from open format(s).

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope]

### Meaning
* Raw and processed data file formats can be instrument/software-dependent, so check the formats generated by the instrument/software you will use.
* Try to convert proprietary format into open format to ensure that your data will be usable in the future.
* The required digital formats of raw and processed data could vary depending on the data repository you will use to share the data, so check what formats are accepted by the chosen repository on its website.

### Example answers
* Raw and/or processed [numeric/video/audio/text...] data files of datasets [Name] and [Name] are in this [proprietary/open] [formats].
* Raw images of the dataset "Phenotype analysis by imaging" are in open format JPEG; spreadsheet of the processed quantification data are in open .csv format.

| ScienceEurope | 1b. What data (for example the kind, formats, and volumes), will be collected or produced? | • Give details on the kind of data: for example numeric (databases, spreadsheets), textual (documents), image, audio, video, and/or mixed media. • Give details on the data format: the way in which the data is encoded for storage, often reflected by the filename extension (for example pdf, xls, doc, txt, or rdf). • Justify the use of certain formats. For example, decisions may be based on staff expertise within the host organisation, a preference for open formats, standards accepted by data repositories, widespread usage within the research community, or on the software or equipment that will be used. • Give preference to open and standard formats as they facilitate sharing and long-term re-use of data (several repositories provide lists of such ‘preferred formats’). |

## 6. What methods or software tools are needed to access data files in proprietary format? Is documentation about the software needed to open the data file provided in the metadata? Is it possible to provide the relevant software (e.g. in open source code)?

### Asked by
[ERC, H2020, HorizonEurope]

<!--### Meaning-->

### Example answers
* Data files in proprietary formats [x,y,z] can be accessed by the software [X and Y], which are open; software info will be described in the documentation associated with the data files.
* Format [x] can only be opened with the proprietary software [Y]; no open format nor open software exists for this data type; software info will be described in the documentation associated with the data files.
* Software to access data files will be provided as open source.

## 7. Per dataset, state its expected volume at the end of the project.

### Asked by
[FWO, ERC, H2020, BELSPO, HorizonEurope]

### Meaning
Data volume doesn't have to be precise; a realistic range of the data volume is sufficient.

How to estimate dataset volume:

* Consider at least all raw data files. Check if processed data are also required by repositories or journals.
* Estimate file size per sample or experiment, based on files previously generated using similar setting.
* Multiply the estimated file size by the number of samples or experiments you are going to generate during the project.

### Example answers
* Phenotype analysis: X images in Y format is about XXX GB; RNA-seq on Arabidopsis: 200 files are about 200GB.
