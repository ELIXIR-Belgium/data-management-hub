## What is data in DMP
DMP is about data, but what does data mean in research data management (RDM)?

Giving a definition of research data is extremely difficult because it is strictly discipline- and context-dependent. However, data can be defined as **information collected to be examined and considered as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation**.

In RDM, definition of data is more related to the role of the data in your research project, rather than to the nature of the data itself. The focus of RDM is more on data collected and used as foundations of your scientific claims, and not on tools or resources used just as "means to an end".

Therefore, laboratory notebook, electronic lab note (ELN), certificate, documents, reports, inventories, etc... are not usually considered data (unless the ELN is your research goal); however, they **contain [(meta)data](metadata)**.\\
The same way of thinking applies to reagents, substances, research materials (such as specimens, biopsies, samples and biomolecules) and living or death organisms (people, animals, plants, bacteria, cells etc); they are not usually considered data, only their **description and measurements are [(meta)data](metadata)**.

Data can be:
* Quantitative or qualitative measurements of a variable (numerical, textual, audiovisual, multimedia etc).
* Software, scripts, algorithm, models, new genome assembly, molecular structures, platforms, collection, databases etc.

## Materials
Biological research materials generated or used during the project (such as new plasmids, primers, cell lines, strains of organisms, specimens, etc) should be shared through public repositories when one exists [repositories](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies/reporting-standards#availability-of-materials) or biobanks and provide accession numbers in the data documentation. For example, [Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org), the European Mouse Mutant Archive ([EMMA](https://www.infrafrontier.eu)), the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program ([EUCOMM](https://www.mousephenotype.org/about-impc/about-ikmc/eucomm/)), [Addgene](http://www.addgene.org), American Type Culture Collection ([ATCC](https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org)). Centralized repositories are equipped to handle the widespread sharing of materials. Such repositories stand to accelerate science by helping the community to make the most of useful reagents and promote scientific reproducibility.

**Information about how you will share research materials CAN be specified in the DMP**.

## Experimental step-by-step protocols
It is good practice to share step-by-step experimental protocols on sharing platforms and provide an identifier or other citation details in the data documentation.

**Information about how you will share experimental protocol CAN be specified in the DMP**.
