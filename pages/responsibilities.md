## 1. [ERC, H2020, HorizonEurope] Describe data quality assurance processes and who will be responsible for it.
### Meaning
Explain how the consistency and quality of data collection will be controlled and documented. This may include processes such as calibration, repeated samples or measurements, standardised data capture, data entry validation, peer review of data, or representation with controlled vocabularies (Science Europe).

People responsible for quality assurance will ensure that appropriate quality documents, such as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), working instructions, conventions, guidelines, forms, templates, logs, tabs, and labels, are determined, developed and implemented.

This may include processes such as calibration, repeated samples or measurements, standardised data capture, data entry validation, peer review of data, or representation with controlled vocabularies. • Outline the roles and responsibilities for data management/stewardship activities for example data capture, metadata production, data quality, storage and backup, data archiving, and data sharing. Name responsible individual(s) where possible. |
