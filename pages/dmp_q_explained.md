title: DMP questions explained
---

Although every funder or university often implements a custom DMP template, they are usually asking the same information using different wording or different order of similar questions. It is possible that some funders focus more on data sharing while other focuses more on documentation and findability, but most DMP templates share the same fundamental questions about data management.

However, the questions of DMP templates from different funders can seem unclear, redundant or open to interpretation due to the fact that they need to be applicable to a wide range of disciplines. Consequently, researchers can sometime struggle to understand what the funders are really trying to ask or would like to know with those questions (see [OpenAIRE and FAIR Data Expert Group survey about Horizon 2020 template for Data Management Plans](https://zenodo.org/record/1120245#.YymZfy8RoUs))

In this section, DMP questions for several Belgian and European funders are broke down to more specific questions to be more clear, more practical and with a focus on Life Sciences. Questions are reordered and mapped to Belgian and European funders' DMP templates. Example answers and guidelines are also provided.
