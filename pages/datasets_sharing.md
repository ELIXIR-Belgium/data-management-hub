## 1. Good reasons to make your datasets open access
European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (2017) states that “Researchers, research institutions and organisations ensure access to data is as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.
Research funders, institutions and reputable journals/publishers with data sharing mandates will normally allow you to opt out of their open data requirements only for legitimate reasons (see below).
Ten reasons to share your data
Ask not what you can do for open data; ask what open data can do for you

## 2. Good reasons to close or restrict access to your datasets
Ethical issues
Personal data
Sensitive data that could potentially cause harm (e.g. to endangered species, vulnerable sites or groups, public health, national security...) if made public. Some personal data are considered sensitive personal data.
Legal or contractual issues
Confidential data (you have a duty or agreed to keep the data confidential)
Third-party data (data are not generated in the course of your own research project, but are supplied to you by another party)
Copy right and/or database right data
Data with potential economic/commercial value

If you want to close or restrict access to your datasets, you must explain your ethical and/or legal issues in the Data Management Plan.
You can ask help to the Legal Team, Tech Transfer Office or Data Protection Officer of your institute.

## 3. Types of restricted access to datasets
Registered access or authentication procedure
Registered access is provided by some data archives, which require potential users to register before they are able to access data files. Registered access allows the data archive to monitor who access data, enabling reminders about conditions of use to be issued.
Registered access must be provided by a data repository

### Data Access Committees (DACs)
A Data Access Committee (DAC) is a organization of one or more named individuals whom are responsible for data release to external requestors based on specific criteria.
A DAC can be part of the data repository
University and/or University Hospital can have a DAC to assist data submission to repositories and assess data access requests
Criteria established by DAC for data access are usually described on the website of the organization

### Non-disclosure agreements
Non-disclosure agreements can be used to share confidential or sensitive data with specific individuals for specific purposes and under specific terms. Contact the Legal Team of your institute if you require a non-disclosure agreement for your data.
The terms of the agreement must be described in the documentation associated with the datasets (metadata)

### Access upon request (not recommended)
In order to manage this type of access a named contact is required for the dataset who would be responsible for making decisions about whether access is granted.
The owner of the data must provide his/her contact in the documentation associated with the datasets (metadata)

### Embargo
It is a defined period of time, imposed by the author, which prohibits access to data. After the embargo period, data becomes Open, Closed or Restricted access.
Reasons for embargo:
Time needed to secure Intellectual Property (IP)
Time needed to publish the results of the research (manuscript) in a journal.
